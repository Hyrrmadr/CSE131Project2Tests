# Test program for UCSD CSE131 Project 2

### Usage

    Usage: test.sh [-cdh] dir
    	-c	use Makefile rule 'compile_custom' instead of 'compile' (has to be setup ahead)
		  -d	use RCdbg instead of RC
    	-h	print this message
    	dir	give the directory to correct


Simply provide the directory containing your code as a program argument.

You can also decide to use `RCdbg` instead of `RC` or use a different Makefile rule (you have to had it yourself to your Makefile as `compile_custom`).

### Example

While in the test directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Hyrrmadr/CSE131Project2Tests.git
    cd CSE131Project2Tests
    ./test.sh ~/CSE131/project2

While in the code directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Hyrrmadr/CSE131Project2Tests.git ~
    ~/CSE131Project2Tests/test.sh .

### Output

The program output the name of the test followed by the encountered errors or `GOOD` in case of success.

The final line contains the number of good results compared to the total number of tests.

Here are the different errors:

 - **COMPILATION BAD**: your compiler couldn't compile the Reduced-C file
 - **MAKE BAD**: `make compile` couldn't compile your assembly file
 - **BAD**: the execution of the binary created from your assembly is different from the expected output

Each of these errors will display the output generated by your compiler (with a `diff`), your Makefile (without a `diff`) or your compiled assembly (with a `diff`).
